        <div class="introduction hidden"><h1>What does digitization mean for Employment?</h1>
        <p>The rapid digitization of the world and the proliferation of modern technology has greatly changed the sphere of employment. From the types of jobs available, to the skills needed to excel at these jobs, to how employees interact with their work, the workforce is almost completely different to what it was just a few decades ago. In this context, digitization in the workforce is broad and multifaceted and can include tools as simple as e-mail and video conferences to robotic automation and artificial intelligence (Vuori, et al., 2018). <p>
           <img src="images/Employment.jpeg" alt="Two people shaking hands in a business setting" class="introduction-img">
        <p>According to Irene Mandl of Eurofound (n.d.), the makeup of available jobs is shifting, with growth in occupations associated with digitization and technology while sectors with lower-skilled routine work face significant losses. The skills needed by employees in today’s workforce are changing as well. More than 70% of EU employees report that they need a basic grasp of ICT (Information and Communications Technology) to perform their essential job duties (Mandl, n.d.). And in countries such as Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Singapore, and the United States over 70% of all job postings in 2019 were in digital occupations, a number that has likely only increased in the five years since (Charles et al., 2022). <p>

        <p>This shifting nature of the job market and of the expectations of employment in the modern world brings with it both advantages and disadvantages for employees. Digitization in employment can provide flexibility and productivity that old analog systems could never attain. In theory, this could open up more free time for employees and allow for greater satisfaction and work-life balance. But in practice, there is still a great risk to employees from digitization. Digital tools can be difficult to use and acquire training, they can make an employee feel like they’re always available and accessible to their work and can increase surveillance. Additionally, while many jobs are being created that make heavy use of highly skilled employees in the digital sector, other lesser skilled jobs are being lost which can increase the digital divide between economic classes. </p></div>
        <div class="pros hidden">
		<h1>Pros</h1>
        <ul>
            <li> Digital tools that enable asynchronistic work (e.g. SharePoint and Teams) grant employees the ability to work flexible hours from wherever they’d like (Vuori, et al., 2018). Remote work has increased significantly in recent years. In 2019, 5.4% of EU workers worked remotely but by 2022 that number increased to 37% (Charles et al., 2022). This flexibility can lead to a positive effect on employee health and wellbeing with findings showing decreased levels of drinking and smoking and improved mental health (Gualano et al., 2023). </li>
            <li>Increasing digitization in employment can make some work tasks easier and faster. Using tools such as automation of routine tasks, employees become more productive and have more time to work on development of work skills (Alobidyeen et al., 2022). </li>
            <li>Digitization of the workforce allows for the creation of millions of new jobs that surround technology, robotics, automation, and artificial intelligence (Mandl, n.d.). The World Economic Forum predicted the creation of 97 million new jobs from 2022 to 2025 in digital sectors (Charles et al., 2022). Most of these jobs have relatively high job security and salary as well. </li>
            <li>Digital tools like Cloud storage help to make the physical workplace environment more efficient and smaller than ever before. These virtual storage locations reduce the need for physical papers and archives, requiring less space (Vuori et al., 2018). Additionally, with more employees working remotely, offices can be smaller and run on less power than in previous decades.  </li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
            
            <li>Digital tools, especially communication tools such as e-mail, text messaging, and chat services like Teams and Slack are making employees feel always available to their employers. Even after the workday has ended or on weekends, employees can be expected to check notifications and respond to emails, cutting into their free time and negatively affecting their well-being (Vuori et al., 2018). This has led to exhaustion and burnout. In a survey by Microsoft of remote workers, 20% reported that “their employers do not care about their work-life balance” (Charles et al., 2022). Additionally, these types of digital tools make workplace surveillance easier than ever before. Employers are able to monitor their employees via digital devices to ensure productivity and focus, which leads to high levels of stress and anxiety (Charles et al., 2022). </li>
            <li>Modern technology is constantly changing and updating. Workers are expected to keep up with these changes despite there sometimes being a lack of training and support. This can create an unrealistic expectation of what digital tools can actually do and how effectively an employee can use them (Vuori et al., 2018). Trying to use frustrating tools they don’t have proper training on can actually decrease employee productivity. </li>
            <li>Communication tools like email, text messaging, and chat services such as Teams and Slack contribute to employees feeling constantly accessible to their employers. Even after the workday has ended or on weekends, employees can be expected to check notifications and respond to emails, cutting into their free time and negatively affecting their well-being (Vuori et al., 2018). Additionally, these types of digital tools make workplace surveillance easier than ever before. Employers are able to monitor their employees via digital devices to ensure productivity and focus, which leads to high levels of stress and anxiety (Charles et al., 2022). </li>
            <li>More broadly, employees that interact with information and communications technologies (ICT) frequently in their workplaces are likely to experience what is known as technostress. Technostress is defined by researchers as “stress experienced by end users in organizations as a result of their use of ICT” (Bondanini et al., 2020, p. 2) and can increase the rate of anxiety and depression amongst employees in digital environments (Galvin et al., 2022). These stressors can include “work overload, ergonomic stresses, the pace of work, role ambiguity, and monotonous and unchallenging ICT tasks” (Bondanini et al., 2020, p. 3). Emerging research shows evidence of negative manifestations of technostress such as “headaches, cardiovascular problems, mood changes, fatigue, anxiety, emotional exhaustion, concentration problems, work-family conflict, burnout, absenteeism, and higher turnover rates” (Sammovigo et al., 2023, p. 2).  </li>
